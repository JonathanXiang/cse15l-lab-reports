# Lab 3: The find command
By Jonathan Xiang

## The iname option
`-iname` is an option for the find command that works very similairly to `-name`

As you can see in the image above, the key difference between `iname` and `-name` is that `iname` isn't case sensitive. This command is especially useful if you want to find a file with the find command and you know the name, but not to a super accurate degree. This allows you to find a file even if your capitalization is wrong.
