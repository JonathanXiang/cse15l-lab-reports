## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

To install Visual Studio Code, go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download
Visual Studio Code for whatever operating system your device is using.

When you are done downloading, launch VScode. Your screen should look
something like the image below, though it may have a different color
scheme.

Step 2: Connect Remotely

To connect remotely, if you are on Windows you have to install git bash
in Visual Studio Code. To do that, download git from this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/).

After that, launch VScode and open a terminal with the command Ctrl + \` ,
then, open the command palette with Ctrl + Shift+ P, type in "Select Profile Default",
and select "Git Bash" from the options.

Now, in your terminal window, click the "+" icon. This new terminal is a git
bash terminal.

If you are on mac, you don't have to do any of these steps as git bash is
automatically installed!
